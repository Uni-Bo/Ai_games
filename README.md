## Customization

Edit `config.py` for:

* `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`: Window size
* `FPS`: Frame rate
* Colors: `BG_COLOR`, `BUTTON_COLOR`, `WHITE`, etc.
* Fonts: `FONT_LARGE`, `FONT_SMALL`

Tweak Q-learning parameters in `utils.py`:

* `ALPHA`, `GAMMA`, `EPSILON`

---

## Persistence (Q-Tables)

* Q-learning data is saved in `.json` files (e.g., `q_table_rps.json`)
* These are created on first run and updated automatically
* Reset via **Settings > Reset AI Data** in-game
* Even games without Q-learning currently have placeholder Q-tables to support future AI upgrades
